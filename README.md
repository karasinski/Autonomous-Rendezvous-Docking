With small failures leading to the loss of an entire spacecraft, innovations in inspection methods are required. The viability of a small inspection satellite with a deliberative or a reactive robotic architecture is discussed and methods for testing the robustness of these systems are developed. Some past docking and machine vision examples in the field are presented as well as their applicable contributions. A navigation system based primarily on machine vision position determination is used to compare the success of two different control system architectures. Each of the two architectures are applied to the same environment, and varying initial states and errors are used to test their ability to adapt to different applications or situations. The fuel burned and time to target are used to quantify the relative performance of the two architectures. The proposed test environment and simulation methods are introduced to serve as a means for acquiring data to develop empirical cause and effect relationships between the different control design parameters.
